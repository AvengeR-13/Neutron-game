<p>Neutron is a two-player abstract strategy game invented by Robert A. Kraus.</p>
<p>This is digital representation of the "Neutron" board game made using JS.</p>

<h3>How to run:</h3>
<p>1. Double-click on "Neutron.html"</p>
<p>2. Choose the game mode and AI algorithm* you are interested in"</p>
<p>3. Play!</p>

*In PvE game mode AI algorithm applies to black pawns only. White pawns always play randomly.

<h4>The AI using the algorithm wins 100/100 matches against the AI playing randomly.

<h3 style=>Rules and Game Play:</h3> <br>
<p>1.The game starts with five white pieces on White's home row (one edge of the board), five black pieces on Black's home row, and the neutron in the center. </p>
<p>2.All pieces move in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but they must move as far as they can go in the chosen direction. They can only move through or onto empty squares and there is no capturing.</p>
<p>3.Play begins with one player moving a piece from the home row. Thereafter on each turn, a player moves first the neutron and then one of his or her pieces.</p>
<p>4.The object of the game is to move the neutron into your home row, cause your opponent to move the neutron into your home row, or to block the neutron completely so your opponent can't move it.</p>
